#🧠 Project Title: Mental Health Support API
Problem Statement

Mental health is a growing concern, particularly among students and professionals facing stress, burnout, and anxiety. Many people hesitate to seek help due to stigma or lack of access to mental health resources.
This project aims to create a Mental Health Support API that allows users to register, log mood entries, track emotional patterns, and access mental health resources or counseling services through a RESTful API.
